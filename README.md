# graphs_and_eulerian_cycles
These functions 1) determine whether a graph is connected, 2) determine whether a graph contains a eulerian cycle, 3) find a eulerian cycle (a cycle that includes all paths in a graph exactly once), and 4) checks that a cycle is a eulerian cycle. The functions require an adjacency list of the form '0 8 9 4 6\n1 3 4 5 7 \n2 8 5 \n3 8 1 5 9 \n4 0 1 7 9\n5 1 2 3 6\n6 0 5\n7 1 4\n8 0 9 2 3\n9 0 8 3 4', where the first number is the node and the following numbers are connected nodes. Two functions, display and read adjacency list, were removed because I didn't write them.
